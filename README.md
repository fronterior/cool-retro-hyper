# Cool Retro Hyper

A Hyper plugin inspired by [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term). It uses the retro preset from the [hyper-postprocessing](https://github.com/slammayjammay/hyper-postprocessing/blob/198f4271fc97fdd7b79473cd0f4a922b5695af68/examples/effects/retro/index.js) plugin to replicate the CRT monitor effect of cool-retro-term.
